Abraham Lincoln once said that if you're a racist, I will attack you with the North.

I'm not superstitious, but I am a little stitious.

Do I need to be liked? Absolutely not. I like to be liked. I enjoy being liked. I have to be liked, but it's not like this compulsive need to be liked, like my need to be praised.
